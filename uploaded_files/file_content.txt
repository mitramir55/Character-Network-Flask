[Music]
lorraine welcome to the show
thanks alan i'm delighted to be with you
well i always like starting off with
something fun with everybody that comes
on if we if we can find something and i
hear you lived on a man-made island yes
that's the first time i think that's
been on the show so tell me about the
man-made island so um during my time in
dubai i lived on the palm jumeirah which
i think most people have heard quite a
bit about
over the years it was an incredible
experience and always a fun fact to be
able to share
and dubai has i've never been but it
seems like a wildly interesting place
just in particular the real estate
development
i i can't wait to to go one day
absolutely one of my favorite places
well laureen i'd love to hear about your
career journey 20 years at ibm then adp
and now you're at phillips 130 year old
company as their evp chief marketing and
e-commerce officer
what motivated you to join you know ibm
and then maybe the other two stops along
the way
yes alan i've had the great privilege of
leading a global community of 3 000
practitioners at phillips who are
absolutely passionate about making a
meaningful impact in the world and
bringing our purpose to life i joined
phillips in february 2020 and i'm based
in amsterdam at our global headquarters
my career spans 25 years in marketing
communications and sales disciplines and
as you rightfully mentioned prior to
joining phillips last year my previous
assignment was at adp
where i was the global cmo and
successfully built the company's digital
first and data driven marketing
organization and efforts i also had the
privilege of leading their first ever
global purpose-driven rebrand
in their 70-year history and prior to
adp i spent over 20 years at ibm where i
held a number of senior marketing
leadership
positions both domestically as well as
internationally and across mature and
growth markets
what motivated me to join ibm straight
out of university was really the
opportunity to join what is an iconic
and relevant brand i felt immense pride
in becoming an ibmer and had the
opportunity to continuously learn
throughout my career and build new
businesses for them around the world
and then at adp i was motivated by the
opportunity to continue to reinvent
myself and to join what was a compelling
organization
at the time and become the global cmo of
a fortune 250 company
with the opportunity to build out their
marketing and communications function
and as i said lead the global rebrand
and then most recently what motivated me
to join phillips is that we have an
incredible purpose which is improving
people's health and well-being through
meaningful innovation
uh with the ambition to touch 2.5
billion people a year by 2030. it's
really an organization that has enjoyed
over 130 years of innovating
always resilient always relevant with
bold moves focusing on technology and
it's and i believe it's a real privilege
for us as marketers to be at phillips
and be the steward of this
compelling purpose we're one of the most
valuable brands in the world and uh
we're starting from a position of
strength so that's a bit about my career
journey and how things have come about
the scale of each of those companies is
unbelievable and it's just if you
reflect on the size of them frankly
and phillips your goal of reaching two
and a half billion people per year i
mean that's amazing
and the purpose work that you've done
both at adp and now at phillips is
pretty interesting as well
now you joined phillips at a very
interesting time uh it was february of
2020 the global pandemic was just
getting underway what was that like
joining the healthcare technology
company during one of the most historic
you know pandemics i i guess the con the
world has seen
well i was just six weeks into my new
role at phillips having relocated to a
new country when the pandemic began and
we went into the first lockdown and
started working from home in the
netherlands but what i will share with
you is that the pandemic really deepened
our commitment to our triple duty of
care to our people our customers and our
business because the pandemic was
impacting all of them in ways that were
unimaginable just a few months earlier
and i truly witnessed and saw that it
reinforced our purpose it sharpened our
focus and it truly enhanced our ability
to tackle challenges with speed and
agility what used to take years now took
weeks
or months in the industry
and you know many times in in times of
crisis people will ask themselves what
can they do to help and the answer isn't
always clear it was very unpredictable
fast-moving events that create an
environment of uncertainty and can leave
us feeling disempowered
and during these early days at phillips
i had a greater appreciation of the
power of the brand purpose
to overcome these obstacles and to drive
our teams to success in even the most
difficult times
we really solve our purpose as our
guiding principle
in response to the pandemic helping to
instill confidence and clarity among our
own people our employees and our
customers alike
and you know our brand purpose and the
marketers that nurture it
will continue to play a critical role as
we look ahead into the next stage of
what the pandemic and the challenges
will bring and present
to us
it's definitely an interesting time and
kudos for you i mean just on a personal
note relocating
adjusting
and then digging in um during this
critical moment both for the company as
well as the world so kudos for that
that's a lot of change all at once
phillips has this unique
mix of b2b and b2c business across
the health continuum
how do you think about that complexity
not every business has both both modes
of business
we are uniquely positioned to leverage
this expertise and experience across
both the clinical and consumer domains
in that we do help healthcare providers
payers
consumers customers really address the
challenges they face by being able to
apply that unique ability
and to develop and deliver solutions
that span the health continuum now we
visualize that healthcare as a continuum
because it really suggests the notion of
continuous care
throughout one's life journey and it
becomes very compelling when we start to
think of this continuum as being
connected
so we ideally at phillips are positioned
to help cust consumers
along their health journey and to
connect them to their caregivers for the
right interventions at the right time
and the right place
and we ultimately want to deliver
integrated solutions that connect the
health continuum by helping individuals
take an active approach to their own
health
breaking down barriers facilitating a
seamless flow of data so that patients
no longer need to answer the same
questions repeatedly
and to give clinicians
the tools that they need to make a
precision diagnosis and deliver
personalized treatment
and ultimately supporting that patient's
recovery when he or she returns home
it's a lot to to do but it does seem
like if you focus on the patient and the
consumer that's kind of the the unifying
thread right everything kind of then
revolves around around their journey
through the care that they receive makes
a lot of sense
so we talked about a lot of change but
you're driving change within the
marketing organization as well you're on
this process of global marketing
transformation can you tell me more
about the journey you're on and
and why
absolutely so we're seeing profound
changes in the healthcare landscape
within the last year we've seen
significant shift where we've witnessed
governments the private sector and the
public
prioritizing and strengthening health
care systems as we all know we're at an
inflection point in health care and
health tech with powerful trends
reshaping our landscape so for example
it's a growing industry with a broad
range of drivers from demographics to
demand for better care and we're seeing
the pressures of growing and aging
populations with rising chronic disease
and we're seeing profound shifts in the
marketplace like digital now allowing
more connections more precision
with ai and personalization
we're also witnessing consumers being
more engaged in their health and an
increasing focus on prevention
as well as a consolidation of retailers
in the consumer space and healthcare
providers and payers in the healthcare
arena as well and then finally a shift
in where healthcare is given and
received out of the hospital and into
the home in other settings and so at
phillips we have such an incredible
responsibility it's our privilege and
our obligation to serve our customers as
many people in society truly depend on
us and i've always felt that as a
marketing leader and given our
experience and privileged position we
need to lead inspire and act responsibly
and therefore play an active role in
addressing these global challenges that
we face
now considering these market dynamics
and shifting trends allen we are
transforming the function at philips to
build world-class capabilities in order
to position philips as ultimately the
leading health tech partner to our
customers and
consumers so that's a bit about the
external lens now if i zoom in to the
function and how we're transforming
within philips my aim as the functional
leader is to build a world-class
marketing and e-commerce function that
ultimately differentiates philips as i
said and we're doing this by driving
compelling and signature end-to-end
experiences across the both the consumer
and professional domains so how are we
evolving marketing at philips we have
built a marketing strategy based on five
strategic priorities or imperatives
which include strengthening
and protecting our brand leadership so
what i mean by that is around our
consumer and professional portfolios to
differentiate us while we also maintain
the strong consumer lifestyle leadership
that most individuals would recognize us
for based on our core or historical
portfolio
number two
really focusing on customer centricity
so very easy to say
very challenging to actually do but this
is really very much about us
prioritizing and relentlessly focusing
on our key audiences
in our portfolio marketing in our value
proposition creation
in our omni-channel planning engagement
activation and loyalty approaches
and third very much around investing and
driving digital first and always on
engagements and commerce to meet the
consumer
in terms of d to c or the customer in
terms of d2b
where and how they want to be engaged
and then fourth of course i have to
mention leading with data driven
marketing and advanced analytics for
insights and predictive intelligence to
help inform us
as we develop very targeted and
effective marketing
activation
and last but not least or i should say
the first four are all possible if we
have the fifth and it's really all about
our people and our talent it's about how
do you strike the right balance between
the art and the science
of our profession and create that high
performance culture
based on agility expertise and
collaboration while we recruit develop
and retain the very best talent with
those contemporary skills so really a
bit about our five strategic priorities
that we believe will get us to world
class at phillips and ultimately
position us as that leading health
technology partner in the marketplace
i love that the fifth element and you
rightfully say that the rest depend on
it or is the people and the talent and i
believe i got the number right from our
previous conversation you've got 000
practitioners of marketing something
like that yes that's right that's a
large group of marketers
how did you
you know how do you engage at that scale
you know and maybe it's just like you
said and where you started which is you
know reflecting on the external
environment and the changes that are
going on there but i just curious like
you know as a people leader how how do
you engage them on this transformation
journey in fact i think it's about
driving real clarity in terms of what
our north star is and what role we play
in the growth of the business and
ultimately to serve our customers and
consumers and we can talk more about
that in terms of how we went about
establishing and really leading the
transformation in depth because it's
certainly
more than just myself as an individual
leader in the organization it takes the
entire leadership team of phillips and
we've been very successful in securing
that commitment
and the support across the organization
but i would say clarity constant
communication and it's really ultimately
the north star that i mentioned earlier
about improving
2.5 billion lives a year that's
meaningful right and i think everyone
can get very much behind that and
understand their individual roles and
how to impact that
i agree that a goal like that in itself
motivating
you know you mentioned your role
includes e-commerce responsibilities as
well so you're the chief marketing and
e-commerce officer that's a unique
combination and i'm just curious
how does that play a role in this
transformation as well and
it seems like
it's a requirement almost but i don't
know if you agree with that yes indeed i
believe the inclusion of e-commerce in
my scope has made the role even more
compelling and impactful to the business
so in leading the global marketing
transformation at philips we've really
invested intelligently
and significantly in driving digital
first and always on engagement in
commerce to meet our consumers and our
customers where and how they want to be
engaged which is absolutely critical
to our engagement and our our success
now we're evolving by taking a holistic
and omni-channel omni-touch approach in
how we interact with these consumers and
customers and becoming digital first
means that we invite we activate we
engage with our customers and consumers
wherever whenever and however they want
and so that has required us to truly
harmonize our tech stack and standardize
automate our data and our processes to
allow for that direct
consumer and patient engagement so we're
really embracing the latest
marketing engagement technologies
including ai and ml
and as well we're looking at emerging
business models and new channels to
enable these across the organization and
create new value exchanges with
customers and consumers
a quick message from our sponsor as more
companies embrace the advantage of
hiring global talent they are realizing
that benefits are still very localized
and constrained by national borders that
is until safety wing decided to do
something about it

problem of remote employee benefits by
offering borderless benefits for remote
and distributed teams

remote health now back to the show
it's a lot right i mean
[Laughter]
to change i mean the business is
changing the environment is changing uh
you know you're motivating employees
with this huge purpose
of impacting two and a half billion
lives per year
and adding channels and new modes of
getting to market if you will and it's a
mouthful just to say all at once frankly
more than a year in now but like um
the pandemic i'm sure threw a monkey
wrench into things but like how do you
feel at this point with the change that
you've been able to uh accumulate to
this point and i know it's a long term
plan i'm sure
it's a journey however i would say
fortunately we leverage the pandemic as
a catalyst to that change to accelerate
our work and to drive the level of
urgency and focus
in order to make this a reality in such
a short period of time so
while we're very pleased and have seen
tremendous uh success
and momentum in the marketplace as
evidenced by our mps scores with
customers and consumers we also believe
that we have a relentless focus of
continuous improvement
to really understand our customers and
consumers needs but not only understand
and but yet anticipate and be able to
address those needs in a rapid fashion
so while we're pleased with the progress
and the momentum we've enjoyed we still
believe that uh there is so much to do
and as we know in our profession it's
changed beyond recognition in the past i
would say even five years
based on as you rightfully said that
technology disruptions new channels new
expectations of customers and consumers
and so um i think we're we're at the
point where we're we're never done right
because we're constantly evolving and
and attempting to anticipate
the future it's amazing what you've been
able to do so far and i i i want to talk
about one more change that you've
recently announced which is the
consolidation of agency relationships
with omd worldwide how did that play a
role in the overall marketing
transformation that you're going through
so alan we recently concluded a review
of our agencies and we appointed omnicom
group
which we would recognize as an industry
leader as our global integrated creative
media and communications agency of
record and we really look to as we're
looking to really extend our leadership
in the health tech
space as that strategic partner that
solutions partner omnicom is going to
play a rather important role in our
world-class capabilities helping us to
deliver personalized differentiated
experiences
and we're going to continue to advance
our digital first and o's on engagement
and e-commerce strategies which as we
said earlier would enable us to meet
customers and consumers where they are
how they want to be engaged and
ultimately live and bring our brand
purpose to life now omnicom brings very
strong capabilities um across all three
disciplines creative media and
communications
to our partnership and they've assembled
an impressive team
led by tbwa for creative
omd for media and fleshman hillard and
ketchum for communications alongside
talent and capabilities across their
network from interbrand critical mass
sounds like through the consolidation
you've been able to like if you will
hone in on the the specific specialties
and like
uh specific kind of um accelerator
capabilities maybe is the best way to
describe that within the broader network
absolutely
you've gone i mean as we've been talking
about this i mean you're the industry is
going through change you're driving
marketing transformation
also on a e-commerce journey
and you know making partner capability
upgrades
what advice would you have for other
cmos that are considering making a
change or starting or leading a
transformation effort well i would say
first and foremost clarity is key the
why the what and the how of the
transformation need to be clearly
articulated and must drive business
impact naturally securing commitment
from the leadership team and within the
marketing organization
are critical to the transformation
success but if i step back for a moment
and think about the context in which we
operate at philips thankfully as we said
we've enjoyed 130 years of innovation
and change
of course we've been uh we've gone under
undergone significant change over the
course of this period and ever so
more recently and so as i think about
our leadership team we are very
reflective of this mindset and this
approach it's a very transformational
forward-looking team we're each driving
great change in our respective
businesses and markets while we're
managing disruptions related to the
various industry challenges we spoke of
earlier so when i outlined for the
executive committee and the supervisory
board the why or rather the reasoning
behind our strategic imperatives and
transformation
and the how
we would deliver on this strategy i had
the full support of the team and they
offered
all of their help and commitment to this
transformation which is real proof that
marketing is truly valued at phillips
and its success is seen as everyone's
responsibility within our leadership
team
and then next was to get the marketing
organization to buy into the vision as
we said earlier that earlier this really
starts with understanding what the north
star is
in our case
when we're improving or aspiring to
improve 2.5 billion
lives per year by 2030 that truly
explains or indicates to our teams and
our people
the ultimate impact that we will have on
the world
and this also means that each individual
and each team within the function has a
role to play
so each team has its strategies that
align and achieve our business goals and
those roll up to our the operations of
our entire organization so for example
if you're in digital marketing and
e-commerce
you have strategies on how you're going
to personalize the digital first
experiences across all touch points
informed by data
if you're on the content team you have
goals and strategies that are aligned
with what it takes to support a persona
based approach and engagement strategies
if you're a marketing manager in one of
our markets your role is to proactively
seek
real-time feedback and data to
understand as we said earlier current
and future
customer
needs and those challenges that are
impacting their world so instead of
launching hundreds of products a year
this should enable us to bundle together
our lead with or what we call champion
products services and solutions to
address specifically those pressing
opportunities or needs we're all
accountable to the business and
ultimately to our customers and
consumers and as everyone specifically
knows his or her individual role and how
it plays with measurements around it as
well i think we're very fortunate to
have such a strong and compelling north
star that everyone understands and can
contribute to based on where they sit in
the organization
i love the way you you detailed the plan
i mean from starting with the leadership
buying and the board to
you know the marketing organization
buy-in that we've talked about and the
frankly what you're just describing
which is the role clarity within the
marketing organization and all of its
independent sub functions so to speak
the goal alignment that you've been
driving and the measurement to to make
sure that you everyone knows if they're
achieving what you're trying to set out
to do it's very structured like i
applaud your efforts like it's kind of
amazing how you've been able to
architect this because a lot of times i
find marketers and anybody that's
frankly going through this much change
sometimes it's hard to step back and see
everything which you've well architected
all of these various components any tips
on how to how to step back and see the
whole plan
well that's very kind of you ellen i
will tell you of course it requires
clear thinking because it is quite a
complex
large-scale transformation that is even
beyond our function of course as our
function touches every aspect of the
business we do need to do quite a bit of
stakeholder alignment
and management to ensure we have the
right commitment moving forward but i do
believe you have to have clear thinking
you need to be able to sequence the
transformation and understand how much
change the organization
can absorb at a given time and certainly
it's uh it's more than myself it's my
leadership team and every leader in the
organization
that lifts this transformation and makes
it a reality for phillips i would also
say it requires discipline
rigor measurements absolutely because
any well performing business is also
very well managed
it reminds me of a book that i'm
listening to on audible right now um
it's i'll give the title if you're
interested which is when when more is
not better it's uh
written by roger martin
who's a former business school head in
canada but a great thinker frankly and
most of it's about systems thinking
frankly and how all of the components
fit together whether he's talking about
the economy overall or democracy system
or
businesses and i think you've got
kind of a systemic approach here that
you're you're attacking on all fronts um
which should make it very sustainable to
to have this change come to life and and
stick frankly
if roger's right
[Laughter]
which i think he is he's uh he's quite
quite a successful uh person and thinker
in this field so but anyway it's worth a
read um or listen
i will definitely check that out and get
that on my summer list for sure
i want to switch gears because we love
to get to know the person behind the
microphone a little bit further and
my
most favorite question to ask frankly is
has there been an experience of your
past that defines or makes up who you
are today absolutely alan i have to
reflect on the time that i spent working
internationally in dubai prague now
amsterdam of course in addition to my
native u.s
i believe these international
experiences have shaped me into a true
global leader these experiences have
changed me both personally and
professionally because i've had the
opportunity to live with and understand
how other cultures influence mindsets
behaviors and motivations
i can only imagine i have not i've
visited many of those places and others
uh but never lived outside the us and uh
i know that's a that's a huge difference
um you know just being able to operate
in many different cultures and it makes
a lot of sense that that would be one of
the things that shaped you
what advice would you give your younger
self if you're starting this journey all
over again
well i guess 2020 is in hindsight you
know is always powerful the importance
of building and nurturing networks is
what i would tell my younger self and to
truly be intentional and take the time
to
cultivate strong personal and
professional networks
early on and throughout my life and
career
as we know everything we do is about
relationships about people about
connections and demonstrating empathy
and i think many times we can be on a
certain career path or trajectory
and potentially neglect the nurturing
and the building that we need to do so
that's truly upon reflection what i
would tell my younger self
as a marketer is there are there any
topics you feel like more other
marketers should be learning more about
or something that you're trying to learn
more about at this moment
so i think understanding the customer or
the consumer
never goes out of style or fashion right
so that's who we are we are the
ambassadors we are the voices of our
customers and consumers and if we truly
understand them we're in order to truly
understand them we're going to need to
walk in their shoes and understand how
they make decisions what challenges they
face what are their desires and how to
have that empathy for them
and then
they'll want a personalized
engaging and convenient or seamless
interaction with you as a brand as
marketers we need to explore
new business models new engagement
strategies on how to build those
relationships hopefully for the long
term
really with both consumers and customers
i would also say
we also have to build
it's that art and science right and we
really need to adopt a stronger data
driven mindset
and capabilities making decisions based
on insights and data
not intuition or opinions of the past
and really expand our use of data
analytics tap into it to really extract
the insights
and really understand how you build that
engagement that retention and ultimately
that loyalty that we
all desire as brands
and then lastly it's really all about
what we said earlier digital first
meeting people where they want to be and
giving them the best possible experience
and to really delight them
all great topics to dig into for sure
on a personal note are there any brands
or companies or causes that you follow
do you think other people should be
taking notice of i've always had a
particular interest in tech and you see
that as a common thread throughout my
career so from my perspective i'm
particularly interested and follow
apple and amazon
those are obvious choices however they
are disruptors not only in their own
categories but even more importantly
across industries and there's so much to
be learned
by studying their customer obsession and
cultures
for sure and amazon
with their in the us anyway most recent
introduction of
prescription drugs they're getting into
the healthcare space as well last
question for you what do you feel like
is either the largest opportunity or
threat to marketers today
from my perspective ellen it's
demonstrating relevance it's both a
threat as well as an opportunity and
what i mean by that is if you think of
internally we as marketers need to
demonstrate relevance by speaking the
language of the business right we have
our own functional
jargon and measurements at the end of
the day however we drive impact to the
business
and
deliver value by
contributing to
profitable revenue growth and market
share gains and so demonstrating that
relevance internally to our leaders and
our teams but also externally and we saw
that very clearly in the pandemic the
brands that were rewarded during the
pandemic demonstrated and maintained
relevance and really were deep rooted
with a sense of purpose
i love that and one of the recent guests
that i've had on uh you probably know
raja rajamanar from mastercard
and his book his new book quantum
marketing i'm a book
advocate today apparently
by the way i'm reading that book so yes
i recognize his his book for sure yeah
well and he talks about that internal
relevance in particular you know in
terms of marketing as a function and
speaking the language of business and
and that's i agree i agree that's a huge
one um not to mention purpose but
as well but that you also mentioned but
uh definitely maintaining our relevance
as as business people business leaders
as well as marketers
so lorraine thank you so much for coming
on the show i've loved learning about
all the change that you're driving and
how how you're doing it it's my pleasure
