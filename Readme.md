# Analyze your favourit Book!

This webapp is created to tell you what characters decide for the plot, who is the dominant one, and how they interact with each other. From November 2022, the website - [Link](https://book-character-network.herokuapp.com/) - can only be run locally since the host shut down its free servers and this app is too big for other free servers. 

*How to use*: clone the project, install Flask, and enter `flask run` in your terminal.
